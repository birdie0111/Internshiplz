<body><p>Titre: Energy-Based Models for Controlled Text Generation</p><p>Date: 2022-04-06</p><p>Organisme: Naver Labs Europe</p><p>Lieu: Grenoble</p><br/><p></p><p>Research internship position at NAVER LABS Europe (Grenoble, France) on Energy-Based Models for Controlled Text Generation</p><p></p><p>Start date: June 2022</p><p>Duration: 5-6 months</p><p></p><p>DESCRIPTION</p><p>Large language models can now be used to generate highly fluent texts.</p><p>However, the synthesized utterances can be deficient on other important levels: semantic consistency, faithfulness to the facts, toxic or socially biased content.</p><p></p><p>Our team has developed several effective solutions on that front [1,2,3,4] exploiting the expressive power of Energy-Based Models in defining constraints over generative models. However, certain challenges remain: (1) How can we quickly adapt to changing control conditions without the need for model retraining? (2) Can we exploit these techniques to improve on hard-to-quantify features, such as safety, unbiasedness, textual coherence, or matching the human intention? (3) Can we improve training speed/robustness, for example, by leveraging techniques from RL?</p><p></p><p>We are looking for a motivated intern to help us develop techniques and algorithms addressing these challenges. Experiments will be conducted on selected text generation tasks using the state of art pre-trained language models.</p><p></p><p>The successful candidate should be enrolled in a graduate program, at the Master or (preferably) PhD level.</p><p></p><p>The intern will work in a team integrated by Hady Elsahar, Marc</p><p>Dymetman, Germ√°n Kruszewski, and Jos Rozen.</p><p></p><p>Publication of this internship's results in major conferences/journals will be strongly encouraged.</p><p></p><p>REQUIRED SKILLS</p><p>-   Strong programming skills</p><p>-   Relevant experience with training Deep Learning models for NLP</p><p>-   Strong mathematical skills</p><p>-   Ability to communicate research</p><p></p><p>OPTIONAL SKILLS</p><p>-   Knowledge of MCMC sampling techniques and/or Reinforcement Learning</p><p>-   Publications at peer-reviewed AI conferences</p><p></p><p>REFERENCES</p><p>[1] Khalifa et al., A Distributional Approach to Controlled Text</p><p>    Generation, In ICLR-2021</p><p>[2] Eikema et al., Sampling from Energy-Based Models with</p><p>    Quality/Efficiency Trade-offs, In CtrlGen at Neurips 2021</p><p>[3] Korbak et al., Energy-Based Models for Code Generation under</p><p>    Compilability Constraints, In NLP4prog at ACL2021</p><p>[4] Korbak et al.
