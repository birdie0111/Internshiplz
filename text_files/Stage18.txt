     Motivation and context

The aim of this internship is to boost applications in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), by focusing on one of their major challenges: multiword expressions (MWEs). MWEs are groups of words which exhibit unpredicted properties (Baldwin & Kim, 2010). Most prominently, their meaning does not straightforwardly derive from the meanings of their components. For instance, faire`make/do' and valoir`be worth sth' are verbs, while their combination yields a noun: faire-valoir`a stooge, a person who is used by somebody to do things that are unpleasant or dishonest'. Similarly, the meaning of casser sa pipe `to die' (literally to break one's pipe) cannot be straightforwardly deduced from the meanings of the individual components. Due to these properties, MWEs are very challenging in applications like machine translation, information retrieval, opinion mining, etc.

A major task related to MWEs is to automatically identify their occurrences in running text (so as to provide more accurate representations to downstream applications). The PARSEME
(https://gitlab.com/parseme/corpora/-/wikis/home) network has been addressing this task via a series of shared tasks on automatic identification of verbal MWEs (https://gitlab.com/parseme/corpora/-/wikis/home#shared-tasks).
Edition 1.1 of the PARSEME shared task (in 2018) showed critical hardness of identifying MWEs which have not been previously seen in the training corpus. Edition 1.2 saw the advent of transformer-based language models (BERT), which brought substantial progress to MWE
identification performances. Still, only modest progress was achieved in generalization over unseen data.

     Objectives

The aim of this internship is to better understand the potential of transformer-based models in generalising over unseen data in MWE
identification. More precisely we wish to:

    -   analyze the results of edition 1.2 of the PARSEME shared task, (https://gitlab.com/parseme/sharedtask-data/-/tree/master/1.2/system-results)
        and in particular those related to unseen data
   -    propose an error analysis methodology for MWEs which are and
        are not correctly identified, and try to understand the reasons
        behind this state of the affairs
   -    put forward recommendations for future enhancements of the
        state-of-the-art MWE identifiers
   -    (depending on the candidate's profile and the length of the
        internship) implement a prototype based on these
        recommendations

     Candidate's profile

   -    2nd or 1st year master student in computational linguistics,
        computer science or alike ; excellent 3rd year bachelor
        students will also be considered
   -    Interests in linguistics and familiarity with language
        technology
   -    Good programming skills, preferably in Python

     Important dates

   -    Application deadline: 24 January 2022 (or until filled)
   -    Notification: 5 February 2022
   -    Position starts: March-May 2022
   -    Position ends: June-July 2022
