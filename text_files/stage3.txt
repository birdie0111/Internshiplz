Research internship position at NAVER LABS Europe (Grenoble, France)
on Energy-Based Models for Controlled Text Generation

Start date: June 2022
Duration: 5-6 months

DESCRIPTION
Large language models can now be used to generate highly fluent texts.
However, the synthesized utterances can be deficient on other important
levels: semantic consistency, faithfulness to the facts, toxic or
socially biased content.

Our team has developed several effective solutions on that front
[1,2,3,4] exploiting the expressive power of Energy-Based Models in
defining constraints over generative models. However, certain
challenges remain: (1) How can we quickly adapt to changing control
conditions without the need for model retraining? (2) Can we exploit
these techniques to improve on hard-to-quantify features, such as
safety, unbiasedness, textual coherence, or matching the human
intention? (3) Can we improve training speed/robustness, for example,
by leveraging techniques from RL?

We are looking for a motivated intern to help us develop techniques
and algorithms addressing these challenges. Experiments will be
conducted on selected text generation tasks using the state of art
pre-trained language models.

The successful candidate should be enrolled in a graduate program, at
the Master or (preferably) PhD level.

The intern will work in a team integrated by Hady Elsahar, Marc
Dymetman, Germ√°n Kruszewski, and Jos Rozen.

Publication of this internship's results in major
conferences/journals
will be strongly encouraged.

REQUIRED SKILLS
-   Strong programming skills
-   Relevant experience with training Deep Learning models for NLP
-   Strong mathematical skills
-   Ability to communicate research

OPTIONAL SKILLS
-   Knowledge of MCMC sampling techniques and/or Reinforcement Learning
-   Publications at peer-reviewed AI conferences
